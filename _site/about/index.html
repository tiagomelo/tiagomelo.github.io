<p>I’ve started my career back in 2003 with <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)">Delphi</a>. Then I’ve moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a> at the beginning of 2004. I’ve became a poliglot in 2007; started to work with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl">Perl</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script">shell scripting</a>.</p>

<p>In 2017 I’ve started to work with <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>. I also became a technical writer in that same year.</p>

<p>My first experience with cloud was at 2009, with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine">Google App Engine</a>. I’ve started wo work with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> in 2014. Nowadays both <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">GCP</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> are the cloud providers that I’m most experienced with.</p>

<p>Regarding databases, I’m seasoned with almost all major relational ones like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database">Oracle</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server">SQL Server</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL">Postgres</a>, as well with some non relational ones like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB">MongoDB</a>.</p>

<p>I’m a big enthusiast of containers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)">Docker</a>, <a href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Docker/Compose">docker-compose</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Helm">Helm charts</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve been developing a lot of different systems, like REST APIs, gRPC services, ETL tools, desktop applications, and so on.</p>

<p>Seasoned with different architectural styles, like microservices, pub/sub, event-driven, actor model, to mention some.</p>

<p>Talking about software development methodologies, I’ve started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming">Extreme Programming</a> back in 2004. In 2005, I’ve worked with <a href="https://cmmiinstitute.com/">CMMI</a>. 2007 marks my introduction to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t have strong preferences regarding programming languages/frameworks/methodologies. I believe in the right tool for each mission.</p>

<p>This website is the space that I’ll use to share technical articles, general tips and my open source contributions.</p>
