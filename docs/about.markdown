I've started my career back in 2003 with [Delphi](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)). Then I've moved to [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) at the beginning of 2004. I've became a poliglot in 2007; started to work with [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)), [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl), [shell scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script).

In 2017 I've started to work with [Go](https://go.dev/). I also became a technical writer in that same year.

My first experience with cloud was at 2009, with [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine). I've started wo work with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) in 2014. Nowadays both [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) are the cloud providers that I'm most experienced with.

Regarding databases, I'm seasoned with almost all major relational ones like [Oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database), [SQL Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server), [MySQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL) and [Postgres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL), as well with some non relational ones like [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB).

I'm a big enthusiast of containers. [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)), [docker-compose](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Docker/Compose), [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes), [Helm charts](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Helm).

I've been developing a lot of different systems, like REST APIs, gRPC services, ETL tools, desktop applications, and so on.

Seasoned with different architectural styles, like microservices, pub/sub, event-driven, actor model, to mention some.

Talking about software development methodologies, I've started with [Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) back in 2004. In 2005, I've worked with [CMMI](https://cmmiinstitute.com/). 2007 marks my introduction to [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) and [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban).

I don't have strong preferences regarding programming languages/frameworks/methodologies. I believe in the right tool for each mission.

This website is the space that I'll use to share technical articles, general tips and my open source contributions.
